# HIDEDaSF
We analyze the physical mechanisms responsible for multi-layer edge-effect formation and propose a new integrated detection and correction framework, incorporating histogram of intensity distribution, edge detection, and spherical spatial filtering (HIDEDaSF). We are willing to make our code freely available once the manuscript is under the revision state.
