# HIDEDaSF
### We are very willing and decide to make our code freely available when our handwriting begins but it should be done for time once the manuscript is under the revision state.
We analyze the physical mechanisms responsible for multi-layer edge-effect formation and propose a new integrated detection and correction framework, incorporating histogram of intensity distribution, edge detection, and spherical spatial filtering (HIDEDaSF).
