# HIDEDaSF
### We are very willing and decide to make our code freely available when our handwriting begins but it should be done if it is under revision.
It is the physical mechanisms responsible for multi-layer edge-effect formation on hyperspectral intensity and we propose a new integrated detection and correction framework, incorporating histogram of intensity distribution, edge detection, and spherical spatial filtering (HIDEDaSF) for the edge effect detection and correction for hyperspectral LiDAR system.
